  <h2>General Advice</h2>
 <br>
 <p><strong>Don't give up so quickly</strong> - it's not meant to be easy. Some levels you'll get right away,</p>
 <p>others you'll be stuck on for days. It's easy to get frustrated, but that satisfaction of</p>
 <p>finally finding the solution is unlike any other feeling & totally worth the effort</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><strong>Be willing to learn</strong> - the game covers many fields of knowledge & you won't know everything</p>
 <p>about each one. Every level is designed to be solvable even if you initially know nothing</p>
 <p>about the topic, as long as you're ready to be patient, learn & do a bit of research</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><strong>If you're stuck</strong> - google & try everything to find the solution, no matter how strange or even</p>
 <p>if you think it's wrong. You might find exactly what you need by accident. This is also a good</p>
 <p>habit for later levels that have almost no hints & require a lot of research & trial & error</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>To add to the above, certain levels contain <strong>hidden hints</strong> - these can be found when you give an</p>
 <p>answer that's incorrect, but is close/related to the actual solution. So again - try everything</p>
