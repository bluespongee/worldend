  <h3>How to write the answers?</h3>
  <p>Write all answers in lower case. If the answer is a number write it as a digit (1) not as a word (one)</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Why do some levels have google bars?</h3>
  <p>It means that you <strong>might</strong> have to google additional information or use an online tool to get the answer</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Do you need any extra software?</h3>
  <p>Some levels require you to use online tools or other software but they're all free, these are things like audacity or paint.net</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Can I mute the background music?</h3>
  <p>Yes but some levels use music as part of the solution so remember to at least check the music every time you reach a new level</p>
