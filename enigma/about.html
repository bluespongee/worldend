  <h3>The Game</h3>
  <p>The goal is to progress through a series of levels</p>
  <p>Each level has a unique puzzle, solve & progress through each one to finish the game</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>How to Play</h3>
  <p>Enigma will teach you everything you need to know as you play along</p>
  <p>The learing curve is steep, but stick with it & after a few levels you'll get the hang of it</p>
  <p>Just remember - answers are always lower-case & numerical answers are written as digits (1), not words (one)</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Why do some levels have google bars?</h3>
  <p>It means that you <strong>might</strong> have to google additional information or use an online tool to get the answer</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Do you need any extra software?</h3>
  <p>Some levels require you to use online tools or other software but they're all free, these are things like audacity or paint.net</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>Can I mute the background music?</h3>
  <p>Yes but some levels use music as part of the solution so remember to at least check the music every time you reach a new level</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h3>---General Advice---</h3>
 <p>1) <strong>A willingness to learn is key</strong> - the game covers many fields of knowledge, but each level is solvable even if you initially know nothing about the topic</p>
 <br>
 <p>2) <strong>Google & try everything</strong> to find the solution, no matter how strange or even if you think it's wrong, you might find exactly what you need by accident</p>
 <br>
 <p>3) To add to this, certain levels contain <strong>hidden hints</strong> - these can be found when you give an answer that's incorrect but is close/related to the actual answer.</p>
