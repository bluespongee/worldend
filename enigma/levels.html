  <h2>How Many Levels?</h2>
 <br>
 <p>Enigma currently has 18 levels split into 3 acts</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><strong>Act 0 [01-06]</strong></p>
 <p>Acts as a tutorial, teaching you the fundamentals</p>
 <p>of Enigma such as how to progress through levels</p>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><strong>Act 1 [07-16]</strong></p>
 <p>Expands on basic concepts & further develops your</p>
 <p>intuition & "feel" for the game</p> 
 <br>
 <br>
 <p><strong>Act 2 [17-??]</strong></p>
 <p>The first major roadblock. More complex ideas & even</p>
 <p>fewer hints make for much less obvious solutions. It </p>
 <p>teaches you patience & dedication as the game only gets</p>
 <p>harder from here on out</p>
